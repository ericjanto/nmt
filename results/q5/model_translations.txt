finally , we must remember the lives of the rights of the law .
mr von , i feel you you understand you understand the vote .
what is the development ?
it is right that we have a solution in this matter .
another important point , the commission is a responsibility that is a gigantic approach .
their people has a lack of concern and their need to be refused .
i am disappointed that we need to take such actions in this respect .
public border needs to be in the world of the purpose of rome .
the complicated enlargement is the principle of subsidiarity for these success .
he also right to do that the eu has a great work of work .
many the new member states , in fact , have not yet been able to play in our priorities .
it is extremely extremely important .
my own country , my colleague , is the right to which the right are to be involved .
at least i am the opinion that this house will be here .
these decisions are the community of the community of the community of consumers .
this applies to the world in berlin our own own policy .
this has proved a good number of errors .
the rapporteur has also been done to this .
mr president , i am talking about the report of the report in mrs randzio - de mrs van report .
this is a great number of member states .
this approach is the case of the principle of the council on the market .
we must know what you must be doing .
our union would also benefit from the creation of the world .
the un way of the french population of the member states are examining by the member states % of the member states .

the free trade is important , but freedom of people is particularly high .
therefore , we have a very support report on this matter .
the government must be more done to their public their public .
this aspect will be a good mind to be made after this aspect .
he has a very good report and i hope that he will take account of the threshold .
the same thing is not only a effective for all the people of society .
nobody can be better than better than the world itself .
perhaps we will not be the reliable system .
the legal base is here here .
i have before the two months to the problem of the presidency .
if we want a body to do then , then we must do that in other words .
the council 's position to me to be the two of the two points for wednesday of the two issues .
( fr ) mr president , mr von , you will have the question , will be allowed .
. ( sv ) i have just just just what you are just just just .
this can be a only effect , but sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes .
i therefore support the report with this report .
we have seen that we have seen that we have to have done .
in fact , whether we are the reliable or who are the result of the result .
many many us is the eu and they want to be put by the eu .
the vote will take place on thursday .
in other context we are not discussing this report .
in this context , a sixth quota per quota per year will be conducted and year .
mrs short , i think mr juncker , is a few one of your reply .


however , our programmes must be seen as a whole , but he will ask this question .
this interests , we are europe and the citizens of the united states .
that is why it is only right and more than the timetable of the situation .
but my appeal is not the council : not a large position .
( the president ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , he was a high time .

the civilian minister against the text against the world of parliament .
i therefore therefore regret that the council has not been done in this area .
the european european integration process in the european parliament is the supreme salmon .
i propose that the message ' s 9 ' s word ' is ' .
let me start with this .
in writing . - ( pt ) the treaty must be a good case of a good principle .
the eu 's bureaucratic and the air are a great deal of the world .
his legacy will not be built on the schengen of the micro of the products .
we want to deal with europe in europe .
mr president , you have to put you with the enlargement of enlargement .
this means the need to break and a more prosperous of implementation of a secondary election .
this is a completely different and old effort to all member states .
it is now now to be allocated to the future for the future for future .
several people are already suffering from the union and hundreds of the number of errors .
it is only only true if we have a resolution to play .
therefore , we should be very clear here , very careful .
i do not want the same of the millennium project .
it was no easy .
we have achieved this .
the latter of the constitutional agreement on a key important role for consumers is a important guarantee for consumers .
in the meantime , we must take a commercial division to be discontinued with the criminal torn torn apart .
i am grateful for the answer .
we also also need to implement other areas , because we must need to continue .
i would like to thank all the reasons for all .
the euro of the world 's presidency in the world is about the world and non - fibre - fibre democracies .
( the president cut off the president )
i would like to refer you to support this resolution .
we thank the rapporteur for a good work for a good report .
however , these authorities are not enough , as they can act , as you can act .
we are ready to go on the issue of order .
we are not only just since the tax that spent to be taken after the label .
it does not simply do not the commission 's situation in the situation .
mr barroso will be a more realistic than without growth , without israel without delay .
another other reform is the agency of the agency of the agency .
together , we are a more different division .
oh , more than who are known to link between procedures and lives .
firstly , we need a personal responsibility of the common responsibility .
that is the seriously of the problems of problems .
are there any objections against the committee on this oral amendment ?
nobody wants to pay for the various objectives of this objectives .
they must be simplified as a first thing .
i voted in the directive of the directive and welcome the directive of the council .
what europe has done is a little for the european market .
solutions can only be used if they will be used if they will be used to do .
this point has already been very low in this point , mr dell'alba .
unfortunately , we are looking to go with you with them .
we need more more than the people of the crisis to be passed .
why are we in this house as parliament has been considered ?
i welcome this initiative .
i know that the budget is a subject of the european parliament is particularly particularly .
in this respect , the name is bad bad .
many of us are the case of the situation that has already been a situation .
that is the situation we have to do it .
in fact , this is also a great deal for the consumer .
there are nothing to be a great solidarity of solidarity .
many of the economic crisis have been introduced from the economic crisis .
it was a fantastic - hoc hoc and that must not be the rule .
they should be built on a schengen register .
it is just only a single rate of the sort of the energy areas of the attention of the attention .
we must therefore ensure that the same thing we have to be found to us .
the situation has already been mentioned in the field of the treaty .
i hope it is possible to be done in the way that it is a result in the way .
then the problems are also strong by the material process .
european integration of the european market is a very good basis .
it was a tax to the millennium patent service .
the eurodac are occupying forces .
in this context , i am very much in the framework - old organisations in this country .
this must happen to this .
in the wto time we are currently the oecd and wear a concrete responsibility .
we will be able to ensure that this question is a question of issue .
we have a band of money to continue to continue .
our primary treaty is the reliable and your economy .
also , the development development is a heated of such a modern policy .
progress must be necessary , when it is not a step to be seen .
it was not enough to possible , but not possible .
it is our partner in the interests , but you know mr commissioner .
and they can not be allowed .
however , we must go a lot of change .
the european union is a little paper .
but the eurodac are among the interests of the european union and the eurodac market .
this is why i voted in belgium , mr lipietz .
i am very keen to say one very small - persistent basis .
i had a lot with one of a number of a distinguished occasion for 11 competences ' times .
therefore , we can not accept amendment no 8 .
six months will not be new in the old old , there are not yet new new new .
voting time is closed .
we must remain really in the way that we need to remain more .
you will be the evaluation of the major area of this area .
enlargement enlargement requires a institutional reform .
they have been done and we must not all do with all .
europe has no intention in the past .
we have the case of the berlin wall and we wish to give the elimination of the transatlantic wall .
as you have done , the commission will be allowed to can .
i therefore voted in favour of the report .
and i would like to make a few words for three reasons to three years .
that is not yet the case , but still still .
i must say that i am thinking in relation to the future of the future i represent .
sometimes we could therefore ask whether the commissioners will be taken into the commissioners .
( da by mr - - mr - - mr - - - commerce )
we have already discussed them with you .
i would like to make three and three words , just just just three points .
this is the condition .
our debate is getting .
in the world , thousands of citizens are fighting in the world citizens .
we must have a iran in iran .
the government has been approved that this is something something .
the second question concerns the exercise .
as i see , the fact that our own areas is clear .
a european european surveillance is a clear point .

i would like to comment to the aim that the aim of the year 2020 per year .
i would like to say mr president , mr president , i would like to say a word to the commission .
we remain able to stick this in this case and will be done .
in short , it can be a number of the century and europe can be europe .
that is what i have to look to the liberals group .
i am not going to know that the best europe is the most most outstanding .

why did you have the right to put the lack of national policy ?
i can not say that i can say a drop instrument .
the previous government must be able to negotiate a great deal of two years .
that is my request .
i can assure the three questions to ask the three question or i would like to ask the question on any question ?
this will be the main aspect of the major aspect .
the commission has been mentioned to the commission in the committee of equal february .
firstly , the question of the referendum between the port procedure between the port .
because 60 60 % of europeans europeans in the europeans .
however , these accounts can not be allowed to the real people .
that can be a great deal of the plant in the region .
are we here about this ?
i would like to hear the commissioner to say or what you said , just said .
however , they are responsible for the entire contribution .
we shall continue to the proposals of the commission 's proposals .
but we are most going to enhance the internal procedure .
mr president , i welcome mr dell'alba ' s report .
what is important to be a single deal ?
we must give the council and so .
solvency for the death penalty - death death penalty
only thus can be a question of procedure to take this question .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i thank you for all your thanks .
the economic and democratic countries was three a three countries .
( the president cut off the speaker )
but the introduction of us has been given by the committee of us .
i am convinced that this process will also be improved yet .

then then , the costs of the costs is also true .
the treaty has now been improved by all 27 member states .

the population is the population of the policy of national policy .
we should therefore be voting to the house of the european people !
the debate is closed .
i will return to two two points on two points .
that is the budget of the world .
only two minutes is about november .
finally , the latter have shown that the products are upset .
i am saying that i can forgive me to make my friend my friend to make me earlier .
this will be the reform of the reform that we are now to change .
it is not possible to have a number of member states .
their resources will be the internet to the internet .
it is entirely different than the mobilisation of information and information of information .
the president can be the most controversial of the immense of the responsibility .
i call the commissioner to refer to the commissioner to the commissioner .
i know that this is the case , but i would like to make it .
i will now now now now to the pilot of the committee .
they will certainly be used to make these things .
russia is a very low process in russia .
the future of european democracy is a mediterranean in order to date .
it should remain sure that the only would not be able to accept this .
here i have heard that i have a speaker to say in the national policy - national policy .
we also also want a register of ability to act .
so there is a serious problem .
this point is still not yet .
we will be able to find a register for a friendly and stable - fibre - sceptics and tax .
why do you think that the enlargement will be the enlargement ?
this report is extremely very critical .
( the minutes was accepted )
what have you been taken in greece ?
many the only - term cases is not the present of national administrations .
we have to assume ourselves in a schengen process .
perhaps the commissioner can also reflect a declaration of the statement .
the joint debate is closed .
you want to know the eu 's own own own market .
europe ( motions ) : see minutes
the same thing is the key thing .
all these things are not more today today .
where are the basic challenge ?
i will hope , however , to make a few points .

( the sitting was suspended at 12.10 a.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
in writing . - i agree .
this is a quote of the cinema for insurance food .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
that is the reliable way , which we can be achieved or can be done .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen .
this is exactly what the european parliament is in his resolution .
i would not like to say quite clear : i am not against the same .

we want to vote on two issues , two basic points .
every day must be built and in his own country in his own country .
naturally , it is also various recommendations to treat the commission 's priorities of the commission .
in the current sector , the current maritime policy is a good step forward .
our demands are quite simply : the eu is simply linked to the labour market !
russia must be examined in all aspects of the french market .
the next item is a example of the principle of this matter .
the process of the people 's party should be built on society .
we should therefore be realistic in the possibilities of the possibilities , which we should be able to manage .
many words and no consideration are not .
public number of public impact has to be further .
we live in a united europe with a europe of a wider europe .
we are doing the members that a three years is the way of the european union .
we are now able to cooperate in a situation which is research .
the present change has to be the things .
the road was not easy .
also of the alternative of the alternative is better better than better .
i am quite quite quite clear for the women of women and men .
let me start that we also have to keep a progress of progress .
that is the positive thing .

this is a number of response to the public which is the european parliament .
however , that is not the matter of not .

the vote now now now proceed on the crisis of the crisis of the crisis of crisis ' s crisis
that is reason to support this policy policy .
as you know , mr von has already said that mr juncker has already been mentioned in other months .
i would like to say something on this possible to be made on this process .
this performance the key means of this report is completed .
we should not be accomplished and different different people .
the european council 's council was a great deal of truth .
only a result can be used in the size of the dispute of the dispute .
this is the prerequisite for transparency and good democratic rules .
but it can be seen as a whole and how how is the constitution .
i believe that the focus of the intergovernmental principle is a further element .
the debate is closed .
this is not the same thing of the quartet of the north of the budget .
we have to have the problem on a europe of europe .
the last last thing we will be very soon , and we will be very soon soon .
thank you , mr short .
what is happening in the european union , and there is a european union ?
firstly , first of the non - term and employment would be consolidated .
prevention is better than cure .
it is a different !
the policy of policy must be done to change this anti .
we want to want to get more and must not be a net strategy .
i find it should be clear .
i have not received a lot , but it was not possible .
the debate is closed .
( de ) madam president , the report contains a good good good good good of good reasons .
are there any new areas or not ?
there are no possibility of both differences to be found to cooperate ?
there is a very low but that is very low .
i would like to thank all the opportunity to him that this debate is the debate .
a separate rate of structural funds is also necessary .
moreover , i believe it remains to be able to assume the advertising of advertising .
we have therefore voted that we have a fair commitment of the eu 's people .
i would like to remind the resolution to the resolution .
learn to you it ?
the eu 's priorities is in the review of the cap of the cap .
thank you very much for your work .
better , you can not accept this way to do about this way .
they will be an majority for transparency and competition , when it is better .
i have a right to read , as i have a compromise about the compromise .
the eu have not adopted such such .
this is the report we do with the report and we do with our report .
europe is the most minister of the story .
i now ask you : what does the commission intend to do about ?
he has been submitted by the commission , what has been said .
this is a very low and very regrettable basis .
commissioner , commissioner - de has already been said , some of the introduction .
the present resolution resolution whether whether or or who are particularly particularly of the market .
or who are falling or the prime minister , and a solution , a solution ?
it is for the iraq of iraq and the resolution .
we will continue to be a more result .
you say that we can not allow ourselves to make a compromise of compromise compromise .
nevertheless , the body must be built to give the future .
i will say to the vote on the vote .
they have also reached the broad of the united states , but also with his member states .
with the future , the british is seeking to speed a risk society .
i now come to the support for the population .
this would be a first step to the first step on a number step .
i believe that this right is very much too a very good history .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
only the eu us us , the possibility crisis , the european crisis crisis .
thank you for your answer , commissioner reding .
i am glad to accept this .
that is a decision of the belgian government .
this is also the reason for the agency of a broad amount of collective .
unfortunately , this will be a majority in this house .
i have to put the commission 's proposal on the commission and it .
madam president , a policy of the west - eastern - border policy is acceptable in the euro of the world .
it will also be a huge role to the spread of the transatlantic committee .
in china , it has not been a very strong task , and we must not forget .
that was the case .
thank you for your view , mr kerr , with your question , with the issue of a question .
mr von speaks a great deal of us than the oecd of these products in the chamber .
however , the eu should not be a fortress europe .
here we have to have a large judges here , what we have already discussed in the past years .
here we have not been more much here in here .
we must also expect them .
the release of the soldiers , was the case of the people .
i voted in favour of the decision of the court of the ‘ power stations .
so it have been a lot of tax and so the rules of the rules of order .
we must take the first of these two , both , as we have done .
we have to have a discussion on this particular situation .
jean - herzegovina - herzegovina is a good level of the environment .
if the rules of the rules can be seen ?
the things of the cap was not as a way and not .
growth must not be seen but , but also , but also .
and the commission has to bear that i think it is a tasks , and it is a tasks .
the same applies to mrs mrs larive 's report .
amendment no 1 relates to the legal basis of the proposal .
i can only hope that this has been said for these products .
this report is the solution for this .
a good role in this good sense can be a good good basis .
for these reasons , we do not voted for this report .
we hope that the accession will be decided to be resolved by the compromise .
child terrorism ( motions ) : see minutes
however , this should therefore be a sensible case in the transatlantic sector .
what we need need to be three principles , the three new rights are .
this is the only way and how that is the world . '
i do not know what the rules you are committed to do so .
this is why this text is therefore a text .
but we want to try to go here .
this will be a initiative of initiative to promote our citizens for our citizens .
we want to want to establish more than the reform , we should be more ambitious here .
thirdly , we should recognise how difficult us to give the task of the european union .
the committee for the committee for the committee has been made for this .
what should happen to be done ?
i can not imagine that this is not what this is .
i wonder what the problem is ?
thank you , commissioner - waldner .
let me refer to the criticism to the criticism for two new commission .
i now now try to the case .
women will be more mep as ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' .

mr president , i really do not interrupt you to interrupt you .
that is the conclusion .
iraq has tried to both the position of the former presidents of the president .
the question is why why we do not have the eu to do so ?
as a whole , the council has been on the issue of article 47 .
the eu 's budget is two of the french people of two power .
mr president , i would not like to make a few words to the commissioner .
naturally , we want to establish illusions to tax .

the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
both the commission should also be able to ensure that it will not be discussed .
this is the aim , because we have achieved us .

the example of italy is still a matter in the time .
the first aspect : 9 9 , 14 , 14 , 14 , 14 , 14 .
the supreme environment is a great deal of the cotonou that is the very regrettable of the consumer .
our own code of our roots is certainly , but we are post .
in this case , unfortunately , unfortunately , the opposite is unfortunately , unfortunately , the ombudsman of the 1990s .
fifth : chemical and non - fuel is also affecting for us to be exempt .
it is a matter of issue , after the efficiency of the european union , the european policy will be the european policy .
the eu must also be solutions to the last people to be able to do something .
the greenland must apply for all .
such a victory is the issue for food safety .
we must also need to make a more stable and stable division in europe .
we are going to be glad with a single approach with difficulties .
the legal process were the process .
i believe that the council should like to be more more than my opinion .
the ombudsman has been taken .
in your statement , you have to think you a part of our citizens .
here is the case .
we need to be a first first of the first process .
we have already done this .
therefore , the commission should be to introduce the commission 's own policy of the market .
but the rich and non - gps alone is not enough .
here we need to follow here .
i do not wish that .
medicine is a great deal of eu energy .
we are simply going to introduce the right track .
i am not therefore understand what mr watson , the woman of the eu has said .
it is for the life for life .
you can say that we know that we know what we know .
the case of the budget is how important is important .
mrs ferrero - waldner , mrs ferrero , mrs short , mrs short , mrs short , mrs short , congratulations !
between november and december , the price of the market on this report has been introduced in a greater bit .
here we are talking about using and must not be dealt with .
the end of the year will be a step forward .
the commission has been adopted by the commission for the council .
the situation is also a great deal for the european union 's european union .
i wish you for the commissioner to be done .
unfortunately , the same thing is not the case in some of the other countries .
we have to stress this pointless on this matter .
the eu must not be able to do about the interests of the french people .
( parliament adopted the text )
it is that that today , and we have a blind deal of a blind deal of a blind eye .
it will be much from the schengen and liberalisation .
i therefore have the report to reject the report only .
the green of fund should be a easier of fund and more profitable .
can it be a matter and how should the future be to be to ?
we can only hope .
i agree with mr von 's speakers on mr dell'alba .
they have a little job in the eu has done .

this is a real way to find a variety of a major degree of the united states .
i wished to mention two points on two points .
the un presidency takes large problems , or will be necessary or still .
i do not want to be more more than the problem , but it is only realistic .
the entire situation in the west situation is worrying .
that is a black - win .
who will pay to the appropriate strategy of the former power .
but the greenland is , however .
we support the measures of measures , for the measures of the report .
you have referred the risk of a crisis of crisis .
i therefore ask you to support some issues on our issues .
thank you , commissioner .
therefore , the commission 's proposals should be given by the committee of the transatlantic committee .
europe is now a key verification of european policy .
that is a very low level .
we all agreed that a tax of oil needs to be diverted .
secondly , the countries are not in this respect , which have not been involved .
the european union and the european union are being sworn .
in some member states , these member states are asking in some member states .
i can not accept this .

the position are three opportunities .
there is no need for a great deal of order .
we have no uniform witness to do so .
mr president , i would like to refer to the question of human rights .
i am the members of you should be able to make a few and more consequences to be consequences .
this is a matter of two importance in two importance .
obviously , everything must be done to do about .
